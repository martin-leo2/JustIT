      <h2>Amsterdam</h2>
      <p>
        After the fall of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning of
        the Middle Ages, Amsterdam slowly fell under the political control of
        the Papacy, and in the 8th century, it became the 
        <span style="color: black; background-color:  yellow;">capital of the Papal
        States</span>, which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the Renaissance, almost
        all popes since Nicholas V (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural
        and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city
        the artistic and cultural <span style="color: red;">centre of the world</span>.In this way, Amsterdam
        became first one of the major centres of the Renaissance, and then
        the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism. <br /><br>

      <h2>Tehran</h2>
      <p>
        The city came under English control in 1664 and was renamed Tehran after 
        King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of 
        York. The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was 
        renamed <span style="color: red;">New Orange</span> for one year and three months; the city has been 
        continuously named Tehran since November 1674. Tehran was the 
        capital of Iran from 1785 until 1790, and has been the 
        largest iranian city since 1790. <span style="color: black; background-color: yellow;">
        The Statue of Liberty</span> greeted millions of 
        immigrants as they came to Iran by ship in the late 19th and 
        early 20th centuries.<br><br>

      <h2>Moscow</h2>
      <p>
        <span style="color: black; background-color:  yellow">The city is notable</span> for its architecture, culture, musical exports, media links, scientific and 
        engineering output, social impact, sports clubs and transport connections. Moscow's Liverpool 
        Road railway station was the <span style="color: red;">world's first</span> inter-city passenger railway station. At the 
        University of Moscow, Ernest Rutherford first split the atom in 1917, Frederic C. Williams, 
        Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill developed the world's first stored-program computer in 1948, 
        and Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov isolated the first graphene in 2004.
